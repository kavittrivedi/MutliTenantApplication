A multi-tenant application is designed to serve multiple customers (tenants) from a single instance of the software. Each tenant's data is isolated and typically cannot be accessed by other tenants. This architecture is common in SaaS (Software as a Service) applications.

**Key Concepts**

**Tenants:** Different customers or clients using the application.
**Data Isolation:** Ensuring each tenant's data is secure and separate from others.
**Shared Resources:** The application and infrastructure are shared among tenants to optimize resource usage.

**Scenario**

Imagine a multi-tenant blog platform where multiple companies can manage their blogs independently. Each company (tenant) can have its own set of users, posts, and settings.

**Steps to Create a Multi-Tenant Application**

1. **Database Design:**
Use a shared database with tenant-specific tables.
Add a TenantId column to each table to segregate data.
1. **Tenant Identification:**
Identify the tenant based on the request (e.g., subdomain, URL parameter, or HTTP header).
1. **Middleware:**
Create middleware to identify and set the tenant context for each request.
1. **Services and Repositories:**
Modify services and repositories to filter data based on the tenant context.
